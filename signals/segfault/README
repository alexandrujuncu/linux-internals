sehfault.c is an example of implementing a signal handler.
I catches SEGV signals.

To compile the program, run:
	make segfault

To start the program, run:
	./segfault


In initial state, the signal handler is the default system one.
It just crashes the process (coredump optional).

Task


Modify the code and activate the SIGSEGV handler function (see TODO).
Recompile and run the program again.
