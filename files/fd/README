fd.c is a simple C program that demonstrate the concepts of file descriptors
and an open file within a process.

To compile the program, run:
	make fd

To run the program, run:
	./fd

You can use the BREAK to make the process wait for a key stroke.
While running the program, monitor the contents of the text file "rick.txt" and
check the contents of /proc/$PID/fd.

You can use the watch + cat commands on the file to monitor the contents.
Be sure to delete the file after each run.
