phone.c is a simple C program used for nohup case study.

To compile the program, run:
	make phone

To start the program, run:
	./phone


In initial state, all signals are treated by default handlers.

Task 1

Compile the program and run it. Observe the PID.
Use the *kill* command to send the HUP signal (SIGHUP) to the phone process.


Task 2

Modify the code and activate the SIGHUP handler function (see TODO).
Recompile and run the phone program.
Send another SIGHUP to the process.


Task 3

Run the phone program again with the *nohup* command.
Use ps to get the current PID of the process.
Send SIHGUP to the process.
