fork.c is a simple C program used for show how processes are created, how
executables are ran, and how environment variables are transmitted.

To compile the program, run:
	make fork

To start the program, run:
	./fork


In the initial form, the first process will fork a child process and both will
sleep until stopped.


Task 1

Compile the program and run it. Observe the PIDs of the two processes.


Task 2

See TODO 1. Toggle the #if to make the child process execute a binary (bash).
In the newly bash shell, observe its PID (run "echo $$") and see the process
tree.


Task 3

See TODO 2. Toggle the #if to set an environment variable in the parent. After
fork-ing and exec-ing, check the value of the variable in the bash process.
